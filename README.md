## How to Use
1. You can spawn drinks as admin. Use /additem Permanent.Code to add drink to inventory.  
2. Or configure recipes on sandbox settings and allow players to craft drinks.

### How to create new recipes?
After the first launch of the game with the Moonshine Elixirs mod, a moonshine-recipes.json (or moonshine-recipes-b42.json) file will be created in the ~/Zomboid/Lua folder. It contains all available recipes in json format. You can change any values in them and add new recipes. The file must contain two blocks: Vanilla for vanilla drink recipes that are already in the game and Exclusive for drink recipes from the Moonshine Elixirs mod.  

## Configuration
In the sandbox settings there is a "Permanent Effects Drinks" tab where you can change the following settings:  

* **Keep Experience** - If enabled, the experience gained will be carried over to the next level when using drinks. Due to the nature of the game, there is a dependence on the state of the character. For example, with a greatly reduced weight or frailty of a character, the accumulated experience may be reduced by 30% or even not saved at all. For the best effect of the drink, the player must take care of the good condition of the character. **Anticheat Type15 must be disabled on the server.**
* **Slender Doe sets weight** - Sets the value of the weight that the player receives when drinking the Slender Doe drink.
* **Allow to build moonshine still** - Allow or disallow players to build Moonshine Still workbench.
* **Allow to brew Vanilla alcohol** - Allow or disallow players to brew Vanilla alcohol such as Bourbon, Wine and Beer on the Moonshine Still workbench.
* **Allow to brew Exclusive alcohol** - Allow or disallow players to brew Exclusive alcohol such as Slender Doe, Nicotine Overdose etc. on the Moonshine Still workbench.
* **Chance for spawn Moonshine Recipe Book in Zombies loot** - Value from 0 to 100 that configures the chance for found Moonshine Recipe Book in zombies.
